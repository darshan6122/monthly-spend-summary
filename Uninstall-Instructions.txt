Uninstall ExpenseReports — two options
======================================

Easiest: From the app
  Open ExpenseReports → menu "ExpenseReports" or "Monthly Reports" → Uninstall ExpenseReports… → confirm. The app will quit and remove itself. No permission prompts.

If you prefer the double-click uninstaller
------------------------------------------

If "Uninstall ExpenseReports.command" won't run when you double-click it, macOS may be blocking it (file from another Mac or the internet).

Do this once:
  1. Right-click (or Control-click) "Uninstall ExpenseReports.command"
  2. Choose "Open"
  3. In the dialog, click "Open" again

After that, double-click will work normally on this Mac.

If it asks for your Mac login password, that's for removing the app from the Applications folder—enter it when prompted.
